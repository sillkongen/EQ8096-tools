This is a utility to upgrade an Ericsson EQ8096 EQAM. When we deployed these devices all over the world I had a problem not having a cross platform solution to upgrade these devices and the official internal tool did not allow us to upgrade from a remote location. 

This small utility made sure we could execute upgrades from a remote terminal session and not only through a local Windows machine.
